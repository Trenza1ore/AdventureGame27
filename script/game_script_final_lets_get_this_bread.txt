The sudden disturbance to your miserable late night stroll makes you angry. You want to yell at whoever is making the noise!

<1>
You turn around to the way you came from. You turn too far and too fast and end up facing the direction of the noise again...
</1>
You walk towards the dead end where the voices are coming from. The people at the dead end become agitated. There are probably three of them.

???:
"It's a cop!"
"shit, shoot!"

The loud noise and sudden movement confuse you. You sway from side to side as you approach them, you have no idea what you want to do next. You hear a gun being fired, and a crash somewhere behind you. You are still in your uniform, so you take out your gun in response.

Detective Mike:
"Alright then! The game is on!"

You shoot at the people in front of you, but you unsurprisingly miss. You yell some more.
"Haha! Now that they've fired me, there's nothing to– to stop me shooting everything I see!"
This feels liberating. You have a lot of bottled up emotions.

???:
"Capo, he's drunk! What do we do?"

You hear police sirens. You find it cute that they missed you, and it hasn't even been one day yet. One of the men took off running. You should too – you don't miss your buddies at all.

???:
"We gotta bail!"
"But what about him? He'll rat us out!"
"We'll take him to boss, he'll give him the right treatment. Hurry!"

You feel something hit your head. Or maybe it was your neck. As your body collapses, your senses cut out. 
It's nice to feel nothing for once.

The mafia base
</title>
[10:40 o'clock]
[A dim room with concrete walls and floor]

Your consciousness returns. Your neck is cramping, and you can't feel your limbs. You realize you are sitting up tied to a chair. You lift your head and your neck protests. A heavy man is sitting in an armchair in front of you. A tall buff man is standing next to the door. The room has no windows, and the dim electric lights are giving you a headache. Or maybe it's the smells of stale air, mold, and your body that all mix together in your nostrils. Yikes.

Man in armchair:
"The sedatives finally wore off – you made me wait. I expect that you don't waste any more of my time"

You think the irony is funny.
The man stands up and walks up to you.
He towers over you, and you don't dare talk back.

Man in front of you:
"Ex-detective Michael Grisham. 32 years old. You were recently divorced and have a 5 year old daughter. You tend to drink when you are stressed, and got wasted last night following your firing. You got mixed in with our men, so we captured you and ran background checks on you."

The man's condescending voice sounded ridiculous to you. You haven't had anyone talk to you like this since sixth grade. You wonder who he even is. He looks somewhat familiar. You blink in confusion while the sedatives are still wearing off.

Man in front of you:
"I am Mariano Giovanni, the boss of the Giovanni mafia family. I bet you feel lucky to see me, eh, with that huge bounty on my head? Well it's a shame you'll never get it! We'd normally kill anyone who disrupts our business, but recently I have found myself in need of a detective. One that wouldn't give away any of our mafia secrets once I let him run free, you know? And what a wonderful coincidence! Why would I bother spending a day bribing cops when I just had a corrupt detective fall into my hands?"

Your head is clearing up. You can't believe your luck. You DO remember the reward for catching this sly mafia boss. And you DO need any money you can get. Now what was he saying about capturing you again-?

Mariano Giovanni:
"Now let's have us a little deal. You see, it seems we got a little rat chewing up our floors. Someone in our family is a dirty little traitor, and he really wants to screw us all over with his dirty little plans. And we have a big business deal approaching. One that will liven up our sad little lives a great deal! My consigliere promised we will be drowning in money, and he has never made a wrong prediction. The traitor knows this, and he wants to expose us and our genius little plans. Now wouldn't that be tragic?"

Giovanni's sing-song voice was filled with malice and impatience. But you will never sympathize with him.
Serves him right!

Mariano Giovanni
"...So I say, you help us weed out the traitor, and I let you go, in exchange for your silence about us. Should you refuse, I've already come up with perfect torture methods for you and your dear little princess.  What do you think?"

Cooperation with the Giovanni mafia family?! What a crazy turn of events! You know by Giovanni's tone of voice that he is sure he has won.

Detective Mike:
"I would never agree to help a mafioso! If your organization is destroyed, then it serves you right and I applaud that traitor! Have you forgotten, I'm a police officer? I serve the law!"

The tall buff man at the door comes up to you. He swings his fist back and hits you in the stomach. The pain almost takes you back to unconsciousness.

[Mafia base]

Mariano Giovanni
"Very well, now you shall be untied. I will assign you a supervisor to keep an eye on you, so don't try anything funny."

The tall buff man unties you from the chair. Blood flow is being restored in your limbs. You cautiously get up and stretch. You would kill for a glass of water. The tall buff man leaves through the door, and an a few seconds comes in with a young man of a presumably low rank.

Mariano Giovanni
"This is your supervisor. You should call him Alleato. His task is to follow you and prevent your escape or attempts to contact the police."

You think that, if needed, you can easily snap the boy's spine in half. How exactly does he intend to control you? But for some reason a voice deep inside you exclaims, "you say that to make yourself feel better, loser."

Mariano Giovanni:
"I have 4 suspects that I believe could be the traitor. First is my underboss, Manuele Bonanno. Second is our associate, Roberto Orazio. Third is the soldier Figlio Inco. Fourth is the consigliere Angelo Rosolino. Alleato is already informed of this and will make sure you interview them all. Come back to me by tomorrow's dawn and tell me your conclusion. Now off you go, we don't have all day!"

Alleato leads you out of the room. You are walking through a twisty corridor, and you are feeling awkward. 

You try to start a conversation.

Detective Mike:
"So where would a good starting point be for this investigation?"

Alleato looks at you in confusion. Perhaps he expects you to already know how to do everything, either because you're a detective, or an adult. His thoughts are wrong either way. You don't know shit and your head is killing you...

Alleato:
"The bar is worth checking out first. It's run by one of our associates and that's where our lot tends to hang. It's right beside our base."

This is great-- you might kill 4 birds with one stone, and you'll get a drink while you're at it!

Press ENTER to leave the mafia base and go to the bar

[11:15]
[The bar]

You arrive at the bar. It is surprisingly empty, apart from a few people. Perhaps it is too early for drinking right now.

Alleato:
"Oh, the consigliere and the soldier that you're looking for are here."

That's all great, but you'd rather have some water first. You realize you don't have any money with you, or your gun. That Giovanni must have taken them as insurance that you will come back to him. Guess you'll have to get your glass of water another way.

Detective Mike:
"Hey Alleato, is it alright if I go to the bathroom first? I'm not feeling that great being tied up and sedated after a crazy night at the pub."

Alleato:
"Alright, but if you take too long I will break down the door. I bet you cops know of clever escapes!"

You enter the toilet. With your headache, you barely notice the smell. You open the tap and greedily drink from it. You slide down to the floor to catch your breath. The ringing in your ears is fading. You can think somewhat clearly for once. You get up and look in the mirror. Staring at your miserable reflection won't cheer you up much, but it's just too tempting. One must always know how much of a mess he is after a rough night. You notice a sticky note in the corner of the mirror.

… It's written in blue ink. In the bottom right corner of the note, there is a tick in black ink and a tick beside it in blue ink.

You find it curious. You exit the bathroom and approach Alleato Maybe this is some mafia custom that you are not aware of.

Detective Mike:
"Hey Alleato, there's a sticky note with cryptic text on the bathroom mirror. It's curious, maybe you can tell me something about that?"

Alleato:
"That is one of the ways members of the mafia and our associates establish meetings with each other. They write a message using their own code and then tick to confirm that the recipient got it. Not a very reliable way – many prefer just asking the bartender to pass on any messages. Though it is more anonymous..."
"You're a detective, aren't you? You're not gonna stick it into your little notebook? What a weird lot you cops are... I thought you guys always collected random scraps you pick up on the streets!"

You pretend to not be offended and decide that perhaps it might come in useful. You take down the note from the mirror. You take out your notebook and your pen.

"Now that you've done your emotional support ritual, how about you interview Figlio Inco? You and him seem to have the same amount of braincells, I'm sure you'll connect just fine!"

Alleato gestured at the man in his 20s sitting on the far right of the bar counter. You approached him.

Figlio Inco:
"Why the heck is there a cop here? Did you bring him here, kid?!"

Alleato:
"It's boss's orders, Figlio. You have to hear him out."

Figlio Inco:
"Fine then, what did you want from me, huh?"

You wonder how you should approach this.

"And how would you do that exactly? You're spitting a lotta big words at me, like you've never made a deal in your life! And why would the boss send you for that? I don't need any help with business!"
</1>
<2>
Perhaps if you knew why he joined this family, you would know his motives to stay, and whether they are weak enough to betray it...

Detective Mike:
"I'm just conducting a wellbeing survey. Maybe you could tell me why you joined this mafia family, for starters?"

The man looks at you weirdly, and you feel like that was the worst question you could ever ask him. You don't know why, and that puzzles you.

Figlio Inco:
"Boss's orders you say? Well kid, you were fooled big time. Miss me with that shit!"
</2>
<3>
Why would a guy with the rank of a soldier plot to expose the mafia? It would be a better use of your time to talk to the other suspects first.
Detective Mike:
"Uh, do you happen to know the whereabouts of..."

You check the smudged writing on the back of your hand. You regret not taking an Italian class in college. You know you've mispronounced these names even before you say them

Detective Mike:
"...Manuele Bonanno, or... uh, Roberto Orazio?"

Figlio Inco:
"Why are you asking me about that jerk, huh?! I'm not telling you shit!"

Figlio Inco leaves the bar in hurry. Your investigation is already going nowhere. Perhaps your social skills are too low to be tricking mafia members -- you should probably take a course on that before you approach this task...

<add clue>

Alleato:
"Don't mind him, he's a weird one. We'll make more progress talking to the consigliere over there."

He gestured to the man in the trench coat on the far left of the bar counter. A consigliere's gotta be a lot more reasonable, you figure. Maybe you'll have better luck with him. The consigliere sat with his head on the counter and an empty glass to his side. Clearly, half past eleven am was not too early for him to drink.

Detective Mike:
"You're Angelo Rosolino, the consigliere, right?"

The man didn't even look up. 

Angelo Rosolino:

[11:45]
[Outside the bar]

You exit the bar and turn the corner. Alleato is leading you to another location where the other suspects could be found. You are taking a shortcut through a narrow passage between two adjacent buildings. You are glad you're not walking out in the hot late-spring sun.
A masked man jumps out from behind a trash can. The sudden motion disorients you, and you fall to the ground. That's lucky because the man had just began swinging his fist at you, and it would have collided with your face otherwise.
Alleato made an alarmed noise. There is no way a scrawny guy like him could take out your opponent, and you don't have your weapons. Plus you're hungover. Your best bet is to run.

Running so far has made you exhausted. You trip and the attacker catches up to you. He starts beating you. A crowd gathers around you. The sight of a cop getting beat up attracts the police. Your attacker backs off. Not wanting to get stopped by the police, you run through and away from the crowd. You gain some distance between you and your attacker.

You reach the end of the bridge and enter Manhattan. The attacker is far behind you for now, so you can take some time to breathe. You slow down to a walk. You wonder why you're even being attacked. Last time you checked, your guts weren't worth a cent...

Perhaps the traitor has found out about your task to weed him out, and is trying to stop your investigation. But how would he find out about you...?
Alleato has pulled you into a bus stop. It's great to have someone else to make decisions for you.You get on a bus (and Alleato paid again), so now you can ride a safe distance away from when you last saw the attacker.
...
...
...
Wait, who is that running towards the bus as it's driving away? Looks like your adventure is not over yet.

Have you ever tried running after the bus? If so, then you know that you never succeed. Which is why there is now an impatient car following your bus. Whoever is chasing you is waiting for you to exit the bus at every bus stop.

You ride until Central Park and exit the bus after failing to shake off the pursuer.

You don't like thinking that you're not important enough to be killed on the spot...

You decide to walk around Battery Park before you come back to your investigation. You find Alleato there waiting for you. You wonder if he has some sort of telepathy powers, or just great stalking skills. When he approaches you, he tells you that the attacker continues to chase you.

[15:37]
[Liberty Island]

Alleato:
"Looks like he gave up pursuing us, but the next ferry isn't until half an hour later. There's a café here, on the Lombardo territory. Rosolino thinks having business with this family is good for us, so I suppose it's alright if you ask them about our suspects. Not all their guys share Rosolino's opinion though, most are quite hostile to us. Go figure!"

You agree to spend some time at the restaurant. You walk in and sit at the window table.
Alleato calls over one of the waitresses, who looks cautiously at you and trots over.

Alleato:
"This is Angelina Lombardo. She is the daughter of her family's boss. This café is often used by members of different mafia families to talk over business disagreements. She waits the tables to pick up juicy drama. She's your best bet in the whole of Manhattan right now."

Angelina Lombardo:
"And you're telling that to a cop exactly why-? If you turn us in, I'll have to kill you on the spot. I won't even care about our families' agreement!"

Detective Mike:
"I'm investigating mafia members as per Giovanni's orders. This kid here is sent to keep an eye on me."

Alleato nods in agreement, with the expression that shows that he clearly doesn't want to be here.
<loop choice>
"Do you know anything about...","What family agreement...","Can I order some coffee?"

Detective Mike:
"Do you know anything about Figlio Inco, Roberto Orazio, Manuele Bonanno, or Angelo Rosolino?"
Angelina Lombardo:
"Of course! Angelo's the Giovanni family's consigliere! He's so generous to us, and really wants to make the most out of our business connections. Our family would be having big losses if it wasn't for him. That man really knows how to make the best decisions. I bet he helped the Giovanni family make a fortune with his brains!"

The is a pause. You wait for her to talk about the other suspects. After a while you poke her further. You suppose that being the boss's daughter, all she really cares about is the source of money – the other suspects just aren't worth their weight in gold for her.

Detective Mike:
"and what about the other suspects? Do you know anything about them?"

Angelina Lombardo:
"Oh, no, they don't hang around these parts..."

</loop 0>
<loop 1>
Detective Mike:
"What family agreement did you have?"

Angelina Lombardo:
"The Vittorio family who govern the Queens borough wanted to take some of our Manhattan businesses on Long Island. The Giovanni family saw an alliance as an opportunity to settle their own disputes with the Vittorio family. So we are currently on good terms with the Giovanni family."

</loop 1>

Detective Mike:
"Can I order some coffee?"

Angelina Lombardo:
"Sure, I'll bring you some after our conversation!"

You find it hard to believe that she's not just a normal waitress. She seems skilled in social interactions – just what you would expect from a woman in her position.
You shoot a glance over at Alleato. He knows he will have to pay for your coffee. He also knows that he must treat you nicely because you are a police officer. You are enjoying these feelings of power!

You dismiss Angelina and she brings you your drink. You finish it quickly and head out to catch the ferry.

[17:30]
[Brooklyn]

You have returned to Brooklyn and are standing near the bar where the mafia meet. You had a crazy day and can't wait to collapse on your bed. But the sunset has reminded you that you have until dawn to find the traitor; you decide to start investigating the other two suspects straight away.

Detective Mike:
"Which casino does the associate Roberto Orazio run?"

Alleato:
"It's a few miles away, so it's best to take a taxi. We have associates in the taxi business, which is quite handy. Let me go into the bar to make a phone call, the taxi will be here soon."

You accompany Alleato into the bar. He uses the telephone in the telephone booth in the corner, while you look around the bar. The consigliere is still here, drowning in his unhappiness. There are a lot more people there than earlier today, and the atmosphere is lively. You wish you could hang out here tonight, but you have an investigation to do...
The evening is chilly, so you wait inside for the taxi. You see it pull up to the bar through the bar window, and the two of you walk outside.

You get into the taxi and the car drives off. The ride takes 10 minutes. You spent the journey looking out the window, deep in thought... Or perhaps you just zoned out. But you like to think you were deep in thought.

As the speeding taxi failed to stop right at the casino entrance, it hit the curb. You heard something heavy slam on the ground behind the car. You turned around, but the opened boot of the taxi was blocking your view. You and Alleato jumped out on the car in alarm.

You run around the vehicle to see what had happened. The bright lights of the casino front and the taillights of the taxi clearly showed a man lying on the ground. By the time you, Alleato, and the taxi driver have gathered around the scene, the man was scurrying to his feet.

He has the same mask on as the attacker earlier today. In fact, you are sure that he IS the attacker.
You grab him before he succeeds to clumsily make a run for it.

Detective Mike:
"Alleato! Take his mask off!"

The man is struggling against your grip, by Alleato pulls the mask off. The man that was hiding in the boot of the car is none other than...

Alleato:
"Figlio Inco!"

In your surprise, you loosen your grip. Figlio sees this as a chance to escape, and dives into the traffic at the crossroads a few yards away. Alleato makes the move to go after him, but you still stand there in confusion. He takes this as a sign to stop the pursuit. You are too embarrassed to tell him that your brain is just incredibly slow.

Taxi Driver:
"Whatever just happened, the man seems alright. I shall be leaving – it's rush hour and my service is in high demand..."

The driver opens the door to the driver's seat. This doesn't feel right. You must question him!

Detective Mike:
"Wait!"

The driver pauses and looks at you.
<loop choice>
"Are you not concerned?","Are you not surprised?","Do you know why?"

What should you say?
</loop choice>
<loop 0>
Detective Mike:
"Are you not concerned about this man's possible injuries?"

Taxi Driver:
"Well, he seems to feel good enough to be running around. I don't suppose he got hurt badly..."

</loop 0>
<loop 1>
Detective Mike:
"Are you not surprised that the man was in the boot?"

Taxi Driver:
"He got in just before you did. I assumed he was with you. You mafia lot do weird things all the time!"

</loop 1>
<loop 2>
Detective Mike:
"Do you know why Figlio his in the boot?"

Taxi Driver:
"Beats me! Since it looks like you're on bad terms with each other, I bet he was trying to spy on you!"

</loop 2>
Taxi Driver:
"If you are done interrogating me, I have some money to make now. Speaking of, you haven't paid for your trip. You'll have to pay for the lunatic's trip as well."

Alleato paid for the trip. He was not happy. You assume you'll have to pay back that money once your investigation is over. That thought does not spark joy.

The taxi drives off, and you are left standing in front of the casino. With no hope of catching Figlio Inco now, you decide to get on with investigating the remaining suspects.

You reach the door...

The door opens.

You almost become deaf as the instantaneous onslaught of laughter, crying, music and the "Ding, Ding", of slot machines drill into your eardrums. You almost regret swinging open the doors. Stepping in you are ushered by a young waitress doing all the basic formalities you expect from a customer service employee, but before she can speak any further, Alleato Interrupts.

Alleato:
"Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Cesare, Giotto, Masaccio".

All it takes are five words to turn the jolly vibrant waitress, into a petrified statue.
(　〇□ 〇)
She takes a huge Gulp and squeaks out:

Waitress:
"Sure sir, please follow me".

As you follow the waitress you see Alleato on full alert, ears perked and head straight; exactly like a gazelle when it senses danger.

Detective Mike:
"Why so worried?"

Alleato:
"It makes no sense, I see a couple of bastards from the Vittorio family. No one visits rival family businesses, it's a death wish."

You quickly make a note of that
<add clue>

The waitress leads you to the back of the bar and continues to several corridors until you reach a door guarded by a monstrosity of a man. You look at him from tip to toe and realize that he must be at least detective mike x4. He smiles a smile of recognition to Alleato and lets him in.  You take that as a sign of entry, but before you can set your foot in a hand strong as concreate smacks you in your face. You hold you right cheeck because it hurts so much.

Bouncer:
"Password"

Detective Mike:
"Wait what?"

Bouncer:
"PASSWORD"

This time the bouncer said it in a much tougher voice.
You stand there bamboozled, thinking, "password? What password? Is he talking about the stuff Alleato 
said to the waitress in the beginning?"

Before you can finish your train of thought, Alleato rushes out and shouts:

Alleato:
"This stronzo is with me, let him in!"

Bouncer:
"You know the rules and so do I. No exception" 

Alleato looks at you with distraught.

Alleato:
"You heard me say them a few minutes ago, don't be stupid enough to forget them, remember you only have once chance, or you can... say goodbye."

The bouncer menacingly looks at you for a minute and slaps you on your left cheek this time sending such a shock of pain you black out.

When you wake up, you find yourself outside in an alleyway. As you rub your cheeks which are puffed red from the slaps, you hear someone...

Alleato:
"Hey imbecile!"

You look at him with a face of shame as you remember what happened.

Alleato:

The green light is given and you strut your way in. As soon as you enter your nostrils are bombarded with the musky smell of sweaty fat men and the smoky aroma of Cuban cigars. The room is full of old men laughing and shouting; but one thing stands out to you, they are all heads of the Vittorio family. What are they doing here? Before you can finish thinking, Alleato talks:

Alleato:
"Sorry to interrupt your evening gentlemen, but I must borrow Mr. Roberto Orazio."

A grumpy old man wearing a cheap brown suit with stains of sauce and bread on it stands up.

Roberto Orazio:
"Ahhhhh, I was expecting you my friend. Word got out that you were looking for me. Come have a seat, I have reserved a place right next to me." 

Alleato looks at you, trying to hide disgust...

Alleato:
"Go, I can't stand the odor in this room  -- it smells like horse manure. I'll be outside, come to me when you're finished."

He isn't wrong, it does smell like horse manure, but not only that -- it also smells like that horse has died.
Alleato leaves and you make your way to Roberto

Detective Mike:
"I'll go straight to the point Mr. Orazio. What are rival family gang members doing here?"

The room goes silent, every eye is upon you. No one talks for a whole minute and you just sit there awkwardly. When suddenly, a Vittorio gang capo speaks:

Vittorio capo:
"è lui stupido, siamo qui perché stiano fumando erba e prendendo in giro voi ragazzi. Stupidi Giovanni!"

And then the room roars in laughter, you sit there still quiet but now more embarrassed. You thought you escaped being the bullied kid in school, but it seems now just like in the classroom – you're being made fun of as an adult age...

Detective Mike:
*whispering to himself*
"I hope I got it right..."

As you finish writing down the words, the laughter dies down. Roberto apologizes on their behalf.

Roberto Orazio:
"They are just making fun of you, don't worry! Tell me: do you have any more problems?"

You think for a bit and then decide you had enough.

Detective Mike:
"Thank you, but I'm all done."

As you are saying this, you are already leaving for the door...

Roberto Orazio:
"Take care detective, and make sure you reach home safe!"

The words are oozing with sarcasm. As you exit you hear them burst out in laughter again. You see Alleato conversing with the bouncer. You approach him.

Detective Mike:
"Let's go, I have all I need... Oh, I need to ask you a question."

Alleato:
"Fire away."

Detective Mike:
"Not here."

As you get out of the casino you figure now is ok to ask Alleato about the capo's speech.

Detective Mike:
"Translate something for me."

You show him the Italian sentence you wrote down.

As Alleato reads the words, his eyes widen.

Alleato:
"Those dumbasses thought you couldn't understand Italian, so they blurted their conspiracy out, hah!"

Detective Mike:
"What does it say?!"

Alleato:
"He's stupid, we're here because we're plotting against and fooling you guys. stupid Giovannis!"

You grin from one eye to the other. You are so happy, you are a genius! "JACKPOT!" you shout.

Detective Mike:
"Wait, what does it say?!"

Alleato:
"He's stupid, we're here because we're smoking weed and making fun of you guys. Stupid Giovanni!"

The bar/again
</title>
[18:45]
[Mafia bar]

You return to the bar in which mafia members spend their free time. You almost feel like a part of the 
family at this point – you've been to this bar 3 times today.

You and Alleato sit down at a table to think through your last move. Your last suspect is Manuele 
Bonanno, the underboss. Alleato is unable to tell you where the underboss could be, and you're stuck 
with figuring this out on your own. The clock is ticking, and you're running out of time.
You stand up and clear your throat.

Detective Mike:
"Uh, excuse me! Would anyone here know where Manuele Bonanno can be found?"

You have to try a few more times before you are noticed by the people in the bar.

???:
"No one knows where he is these days, get with the times! Always running off for shady business..."
"Probably planning to murder the boss to get his hands on the fat cash, hahaha!"
"Abusing his power to boss soldiers around, I bet!"
"Why would a cop even need to know?! Someone get security--"

You don't even want to think about the consequences if you fail to uncover the traitor. You order a glass of something, and hope Alleato still has some money to spare. You are not drinking tap water again.

The consigliere that is still at the bar counter is whining about his pathetic life again. You hope it's not contagious...

Angelo Rosolino:
"Me and Angie are just like Romeo and Juliet."
(╥﹏╥)
"If I marry her, I'll be killed by the boss. There's truly only one way out of this misery."
(ಥ⌣ಥ)
"But what a gigantic task that would be! Oh wait, I was the one who pushed the boss the idea--"
(☉o☉)
"Ahahahaa~ I need to stop drinking."

It seems like it is telling the date and time of a meeting, and the letters must mean the meeting place!

Detective Mike:
"Hey Alleato, what's the date today?"

Alleato:
"May the second. My cousin's friend's goldfish's birthday. A shame I couldn't attend..."

You feel somewhat responsible that Alleato missed the birthday party. But it wasn't your intention to get kidnapped, so really the responsibility isn't yours at all!
...
Wait, what were you thinking again? You look at the 3 empty glasses in front of you as you rack your brains for the reason you're feeling emotional about a goldfish.

"Ah..."

Alleato sighed. It's like his adventures with you never end.
You still have plenty of time. You could try making sense of all your clues and talk to more people, but... You are feeling very full of yourself for figuring out the clue that may or may not even be correct, so you decide to pass out on the table for a few hours. You totally deserve this.

The warehouse

[03:43]
[The abandoned warehouse]

You pull up to the abandoned warehouse in a taxi. Alleato had to literally drag you into it, and now that you're comfortable on the soft leather seat, you have no desire to get out of it into the cold night.
...
It is the time of the deal, but you still have to search every corner of the building before you can witness it. You hope you won't be late. And most of all, you hope you deciphered the note correctly.

You and Alleato carefully walk through the concrete structure with flashlights. It wasn't until you reached the upper floor of the building that you heard voices. You turn off your flashlights and follow the sound.

Alleato:
*whispering*
"Hey, that voice is definitely our underboss! I can't believe that note you deciphered was legit!"

You hide behind a wall some more, maybe if you eavesdrop a little, you'll learn something interesting?

Detective Mike:
"Hang on a second... That other voice..."

You peek out from behind the wall. You can see the silhouettes of the two people.

Detective Mike:
"That's a fellow police officer! What the hell is he doing here?!"

You whisper came oud louder than you meant. The two people hurried over in your direction. Alleato pulled out his gun.

They rounded the corner to where you and Alleato were hiding. Simultaneously, you turned on a flashlight and pointed it at the underboss, and Alleato yelled.

Alleato:
"We are armed! We came upon Giovanni's orders! We don't intend to fight!"

The four of you stood in a circle, pointing something at each other for a few hot seconds as you analyzed the situation.

Police officer:
"G-Grisham! What the hell are you doing here? You also work for the mafia? Or did you come to bust us?"

Detective Mike:
"I got involved due to circumstances outside of my control. I doubt you can say the same!"

You figure that the police officer is the least of your problems right now. The sun will rise in about 2 hours.
You need to get this investigation finished.

Detective Mike:
"I came to interview Manuele Bonanno as per Mariano Giovanni's orders. I saw the note left on the toilet mirror at the mafia bar and figured this was my best bet to find him. No one around us had a clue where he disappeared to. I do not intend to deal with you, Lewis. I'm on a tight time limit and would appreciate if you didn't make this complicated."

Manuele Bonanno dismisses the police officer, though he doesn't put away his weapon. This situation is gonna be a pain in the ass to untangle. Thankfully, you have a (literal) partner in crime to de-escalate the situation.

Alleato:
"He's doing some detective work to smooth out a bunch of conflicts that have been cropping up. Just answer his questions well enough and he'll stop pestering you."

Manuele Bonanno:
"Alright then, what did you want from me? You interrupted a deal that could've made us a fortune!"

"Well you'd think that the boss's son would be the underboss, but I guess I, the nephew, am just a lot more suited for the position! The man's still sour that he's just a mere soldier~"

Wow - this man's ego is so big, it fills up teh entire warehouse!

Manuele Bonanno:
"Well you're one of em, aren't ya? I don't see why you would be so surprised."

Detective Mike:
"I didn't get involved out of my own will. I was kidnapped and threatened into cooperation. I never would have guessed my co-workers were this corrupt, and yet I got fired just because I drank on the job a few times?!"

Manuele Bonanno:
"The whole point is that the chiefs and other police officers don't know you work with us! But this line of work is quite new to us. Our family focuses more on casinos and taxis and the like."

Detective Mike:
"So why did you decide to start working with us?"

Manuele Bonanno:
"I don't know why Mariano wanted to work with you specifically, but I am planning to chang or business a little if something happens to our boss. As the underboss, it's my responsibility to secure a bright future for our mafia family, you see? And I'm having my doubts about Orazio and his casino..."

That makes sense.

</loop 1>
<loop 2>
Detective Mike:
"As the underboss, I presume you know something about Figlio Inco? That man has been worrying me..."

Manuele Bonanno:
"Oh, the boss's son? Yeah, he can be a handful, but is totally harmless. And why did you shorten his nickname? It sounds less silly that way~"

Detective Mike:
"Hang on, did you just say he's Giovanni's son?! And what do you mean shortening the nickname?"

Manuele Bonanno:
"Well, he's really caleld Alberto Giovanni, but we all know him as Figlio Incompetente. You know, the incompetent son."

How did you never even stop to think, "what kinda last name is Inco"? On yeah, cuz you don't speak a lick of Italian

Detective Mike:
"So you don't think he's a threat to anyone then? He attacked me and then attempted to follow me on my investigation!"

Manuele Bonanno:
"The key word here is 'attempted'. The guy never gets anywhere with his silly circus tricks."

You are not convinced.

</loop 2>

Manuele Bonanno:
"If we're done here, I have more important things to do. I cannot waste any time since the future of our family rests on my shoulders!"

Alleato:
"Yeah I'm pretty sure he's just gonna go drink at the bar..."

Alleato leads you back to the boss's office in the mafia base. You knock on the door. You hear an impatient "come in!". You open the door and walk in. Mariano Giovanni is sitting at a solid dark-coloured desk.

Mariano Giovanni:
"You came to tell me the good news, I expect?"

Detective Mike:
"Yes, uh... Sir?"

The boss laughed with a sound that resonated throughout the whole room. Maybe the formality wasn't necessary, but you'd like to keep your head connected to your body if possible.

Mariano Giovanni:
"Well then, who is the traitor?"

Giovanni is tapping his fingers impatiently on the desk...
tap
Tap
TAP!

Hmm... Who did you find has a motive that requires this mafia family to be taken down? It's hard to say right off the bat!

- The underboss Manuele Bonanno wants to become the boss of the family.
- The consigliere Angelo Rosolino is romantically involved with the underboss of an ally mafia 
  family.
- The soldier Alberto Giovanni wants to become the underboss of the family.
- The associate Roberto Orazio wants to work with a rival mafia family.

Your thoughts are interrupted by the boss.

Mariano Giovanni:
"Are you ready to give me an answer yet? It's the beginning of sunrise and you will pay with your daughter's life if you don't complete your task, hahaha!"

Detective Mike:
"I want to clarify something first."
"Can you tell me about Manuele Bonanno?"

Mariano Giovanni:
"Ah, the underboss! He does his job extremely well. I never made as much money when I had other underbosses..."

Detective Mike:
"I'm not surprised, he's trying to make deals with everyone in Brooklyn! He even got the police on his side!"

Mariano Giovanni:
"Well that's the first time I hear of that! He must report all his operations to me, and yet he never told me he was expanding our business..."

Detective Mike:
"I want to clarify something first."
"What do you know about Angelo Rosolino?"

Mariano Giovanni:
"What an excellent consigliere he is... When he became determined to make an alliance between the Giovanni and the Lombardo family happen, I was skeptical about its benefits. But it allowed us to gain more resources to defend against the Vittorio family's aggressive attacks."

Detective Mike:
"Has he been doing his job well recently?"

Mariano Giovanni:
"I have no big complaints. Though his eagerness for alliance does not sit well with me – our family must be able to do business and protect its territory independently. He goes on far too many meetings with the Lombardo family..."

Detective Mike:
"I want to clarify something first."
"About Alberto Giovanni-"

Mariano Giovanni:
"Ah, you found Figlio's real name! To be honest, everyone calls him Figlio Incompetente so I completely forgot he even has a real name, haha!"

Detective Mike:
"He is your son, correct? Why is he not the underboss?"

Mariano Giovanni:
"He is incapable of doing the jobs expected of the underboss, and will not be a good successor to me. Being a soldier suits him better."

Detective Mike:
"He seems to be on bad terms with Bonanno?"
"He's jealous of course, even furious! Bonnano took up the place Alberto was supposed to occupy. That's quite the tragedy..."

Detective Mike:
"I want to clarify something first."
"Roberto Orazio confuses me..."

Mariano Giovanni:
"Yes, this associate is a sly man – what else would you expect from a casino owner?! But that works in his favor in his business, so he is a valuable associate for us."

Detective Mike:
"I saw Vittorio family members in the associate's casino."

Mariano Giovanni:
"It doesn't bother me who frequents that casino. No matter who it is, they spend money on drinks and games, and we inevitably profit from them. Though since the Vittorio family has more power in New York City, I may need to have a little chat with Roberto~"

Mariano Giovanni:
"Well then, I shall execute this man. Listen here, you rat! You better not be playing games with me. If the business deal gets exposed, your life will turn very sour! Now you will get your ass out of this building, and not rat us out to your police buddies. I hope we never meet again."

[May 5th]
[Your apartment]

It has been 2 days since your Giovanni family detective work. Can't really say life has returned to normal yet, but at least you got enough sleep last night, ate 3 meals, and have seen the outside.
Oh, and of course, you won custody over your daughter. Things are starting to look up – perhaps you should start searching for a new job soon!
You sit down on the sofa in front of the TV with Libby; your favourite film is coming on after the news. 
You've got snacks ready, and have the next bedtime story you want to read her in mind. You switch off the lights and get buried in blankets and pillows.

Today is the day the big mafia deal was supposed to happen. If you've accused the wrong person of being the traitor, the deal will be exposed, and you will be punished.
You turn on the TV. The news presenter is summarizing the news of the day.

Looks like nothing of note has happened today. 
You zone out for the rest of the news program, feeling relieved.
You take a deep breath and open your first bag of snacks. 
Your favourite film is starting.

Your blood runs cold.
Your conclusion was wrong.
You hear a knock on your apartment door.
